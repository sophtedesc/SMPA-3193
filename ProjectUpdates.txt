This past week, our group has done research into our individual project suggests to determine which would be a more suitable and reasonable project.
Next week, we plan on getting your input on our developed thoughts to see which project is leaning in the right direction, and which you think would be most doable.

I am leaning away from the idea of tracking the salaries of non-profit organizations to see how the salaries differ by organization for the same title or job since I don't think this is interesting enough for a final project unless there is another direction we can go in that will report new information?
